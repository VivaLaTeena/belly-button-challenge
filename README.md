# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This repository contains a web application that explores the "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The interactive dashboard provides visualizations of the top Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in individuals' belly buttons, along with metadata for each individual.

## Assignment Overview

This web application was created as part of an assignment for University of TX, Data Analytics Boot Camp - Interactive visulizations. The assignment required building an interactive dashboard with the following features:

- A dropdown menu to select a specific individual's data.
- A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual.
- A bubble chart showing each OTU's sample values.
- Display of the selected individual's demographic information.

The assignment also encouraged deploying the web application to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.

## How to Use the Application

1. Visit the interactive dashboard: file:///Users/titi/Desktop/belly-button-challenge-main/index.html , https://github.com/VivaLaTeena/belly-button-challenge.git
2. Select an individual's ID from the dropdown menu to explore their microbiome data.
3. View the top 10 OTUs in a horizontal bar chart.
4. Examine the bubble chart to understand the distribution of OTUs.
5. Review the individual's demographic information in the metadata panel.

## Technologies Used
